# FiestaMate
FiestaMate is an app that allows users to plan their schedule when attending festivals or events. 

Attendees can view available events and food options, add them to their personal schedule, and export schedules as PDF files.

Requiring only a CSV and text file with the festival and event details, FiestaMate enables attendees to make the most of their festival experience by simplifying the planning process.
